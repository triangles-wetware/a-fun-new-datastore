Copilot definitely tried to make me a Kitty; I must stop being rude to Copilot! It correctly identified the default kitty emotion to be "Murder"...
I understand you are trying to implement emotion into your project. Let's focus on integrating emotional states into the Ao struct and enhancing its functionality.

Key Steps to Implement Emotional States:
Integrate Emotional States into the Ao Struct
Implement Methods to Update and React to Emotional States
Test the Integration
Example Code Implementation:
Rust
// Adding emotional states to the Ao struct
pub struct Ao {
    state: AoState,
    current_bolt: u8,
    tick_count: u32,
    emotion: CatEmotion, // Add emotion to the Ao struct
}

impl Ao {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            state: AoState::Seed(Seed::Growing(0)),
            current_bolt: 0,
            tick_count: 0,
            emotion: CatEmotion::Kitty(0), // Initialize with a default emotion
        }
    }

    // Method to update emotion
    pub fn update_emotion(&mut self, new_emotion: CatEmotion) {
        self.emotion = new_emotion;
    }

    // Method to make a decision based on emotion
    pub fn decide(&self) -> String {
        match self.emotion {
            CatEmotion::Kitty(_) => "Playful decision".to_string(),
            CatEmotion::Murder => "Aggressive decision".to_string(),
            CatEmotion::Vengeance(_) => "Vengeful decision".to_string(),
            CatEmotion::Terror(_) => "Fearful decision".to_string(),
        }
    }

    // Other methods...
}

fn main() {
    let mut ao = Ao::new();
    ao.update_emotion(CatEmotion::Murder);
    println!("{}", ao.decide());
}
This example initializes an Ao instance with an emotional state and makes decisions based on that state. You can expand this further by integrating more complex emotional transitions and context-aware behaviors.

If you have any specific requirements or additional features you want to implement, please let me know!
